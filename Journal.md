According to the reading, digital history arguments aim to build a bridge to obstacles to professional recognition of those interpretations. 

On the one hand, "digital history arguments aim to demonstrate to the wider historical discipline how digital history is already making arguments in different forms than analog scholarship."(2017)

"On the other hand, it aims to help digital historians weave the scholarship they produce into historiographical conversations in the discipline." (2017)

In my view, digital history refers to a new communication way of technologies, software systems, and computer design. Digital history arguments provided digital workers with a better experience of solving digital problems.
